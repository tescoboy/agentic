# Reference Repositories

This directory contains read-only copies of reference repositories for pattern extraction and code reference.

## Repositories

- `salesagent/` - Sales agent implementation patterns
- `adcp/` - AdCP protocol implementation patterns

## Usage Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: These are read-only reference repositories.**

- ✅ Copy specific files or functions where appropriate
- ✅ Cite source paths in comments when adapting code
- ✅ Use as pattern reference for implementation
- ❌ Never treat as dependencies
- ❌ Never push changes to these repositories
- ❌ Never modify the original repositories

## Cloning Instructions

Run these commands to populate the reference repositories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/salesagent.git reference/salesagent
git clone https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp.git reference/adcp
```

## Purpose

These repositories serve as:
- Implementation pattern reference
- API design inspiration
- Code structure examples
- Best practice guidance

Adapt the patterns to fit this project's architecture and constraints.
